How to setup (After creating a blank project normally)

1. Add all java files to java folder (there are 2 mainactivity.java files. You probably don't want the databaseexample one; it's just debugging database stuff but I put it there if anyone wanted to see how it worked)
2. Add string.xml to value folder
3. Add activity_main.xml and detail_dialog.xml to layout folder
4. Add all the images to all the image folder
5. replace the AndroidManifest.xml with the AndroidManifest.xml in the repo
6. change all package names in the java files to be your projects name (com.example.YOURNAME)
